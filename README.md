# Geeboy 

## Introduction
This project is being developed as part of an effort to get a better understanding of how older systems dealt with 
limitations that we don't see as often in modern computing, such as limited memory and processing power. The 
Nintendo Gameboy is an excellent case study, as it featured removable and banked RAM/ROM, a CPU that seems to be 
based on a hybrid between the Z80 and the 8080, and some very neat tricks that gave let it run on the charge of a 
few AA batters for hundreds of hours.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x

I've spent a lot of time getting intimate with the GameBoy CPU Manual, accessible at:
